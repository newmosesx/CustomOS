Kernel: The core of the OS, the kernel manages the CPU, memory, and peripherals. It is the first program loaded on startup and resides in the main memory. It handles process execution, interrupts, memory management, and provides a fundamental level of control over the computer's hardware.

Process Management: The OS is responsible for managing the execution of applications and system processes. This includes scheduling tasks, allocating resources, and ensuring that processes do not interfere with one another.

Memory Management: The OS manages the computer's primary memory (RAM), allocating it to running processes and deallocating it when they close. It also handles virtual memory, which gives programs the illusion of having more memory than is physically available.

File System Management: It provides a structure for organizing and storing files on storage devices. This includes creating, deleting, and managing files and directories.

Device Management: The OS controls communication with hardware devices through drivers. It manages input/output operations and allocates devices to processes.

User Interface (UI): This allows users to interact with the operating system. It can be a graphical user interface (GUI) with icons and windows, or a command-line interface (CLI) that uses text-based commands.

Networking: Modern operating systems provide the protocols and services necessary for computers to communicate with each other over a network.

Security: The OS is responsible for protecting the system from unauthorized access and malicious software. This includes user authentication, file permissions, and other security features.


Android Compatibility:

1.Set up a Linux build environment.

2.Download the AOSP source code.

3.Download the Android-x86 source code patches.

4.Apply the patches to the AOSP source.

5.Configure the build for an x86 target.

6.Compile the code, which can take several hours.

7.Package the result into a bootable ISO file.

The Android-x86 project has documentation on how to do this on their website.
