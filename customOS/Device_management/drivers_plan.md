Device Drivers (Storage First): We can't have a filesystem without being able to read and write to a storage device.

    Storage Controller Driver: Write a driver for a storage controller like SATA (AHCI) or NVMe. This is a complex task and requires carefully reading the hardware specifications. I RECOMMEND USING AN EMPTY REMOVABLE DEVICE FIRST.
