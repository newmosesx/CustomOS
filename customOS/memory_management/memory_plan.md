Memory Management (The True Foundation): This must come before process management. You cannot create a process if you cannot give it memory.

    Part A: Physical Memory Manager (PMM): First, we need to know which parts of the physical RAM are available and which are reserved by hardware or the kernel itself. The PMM (often a bitmap or linked-list allocator) tracks free and used RAM pages.

    Part B: Virtual Memory Manager (VMM): Next, implement paging. This is the mechanism that gives each process its own isolated, virtual address space. We'll set up page tables and page directories, and write the code to enable paging on the CPU. The VMM will use the PMM to get physical frames to map virtual pages to.

Process and Thread Scheduler:

    Timer Interrupt: We'll need a driver for the system timer (like the PIT or HPET). We'll configure it to fire an interrupt periodically (e.g., every 10ms).

    Scheduler Logic: The interrupt handler for the timer will call the scheduler. The scheduler's job is to save the state of the currently running process and switch to another one. Start with a simple round-robin algorithm. This creates the illusion of multitasking.
